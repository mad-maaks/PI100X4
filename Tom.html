					<span>Dear Mary, giving comfort and sweet peace</span><br>
                    <span>To all afflicted mortals, thou the spring</span><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Here, we see Rizal addressing the Virgin Mary with reverence, acknowledging her as a source of comfort for those who are suffering. He describes Mary as a spring, symbolizing a continuous source of relief for everyone.
				  </span>
				</div>
				<div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>Whence flows a current of relief, to bring</span><br>
					<span>Our soil fertility that does not cease:</span><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					The imagery of a flowing current suggests a steady and abundant provision of comfort. Rizal then uses the metaphor of fertile soil to depict the nurturing nature of Mary towards the believers.
				  </span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>Upon thy throne, where thou dest reign on high,</span><br>
                    <span>Oh, list” with pity as I weeful grieve</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Rizal pleads with Mary to listen to his sorrowful cries, seeking her empathy and understanding.
				</span>
			  </div>
              <div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>And spread thy radiant mantle to receive</span><br>
					<span>My voice which rises swiftly to the sky</span><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					He further asks Mary for her care and protection over him. In the second line, Rizal’s voice represents his prayers and pleas which he describes to have ascended swiftly to the sky, indicating an urgent answer to his prayers.
				  </span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>Placid Mary, thou my mother dear,</span><br>
                    <span>My sustenance, my fortitude must be,</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					He then refers to Mary as “placid” or calm and serene and “mother dear”, expressing his deep connection towards her, and declares Mary as his source of spiritual nourishment.
				</span>
			  </div>
              <div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>And in this fearsome sea my way must steer.</span><br>
					<span>If deprivation comes to buffet me,</span><br>
                    <span>“And if grim death in agony draws near,</span><br>
                    <span>Oh, succor me, from anguish set me free.</span>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Here, Rizal likens life to a fearsome sea, full of challenges and dangers. He looks to Mary for guidance and protection from these, and asks her to prepare him for further trials in life. Rizal concludes his poem by expressing his prayers for Mary to come to his aid and free him from his suffering.
