					<span>This festive day?</span><br><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Rizal first begins by showing an image of a garden around him. He describes the “scented bowers” or garden alcoves, which are competing with each other in terms of fragrance and beauty. This competition among the flowers is depicted as a celebration of a special event.

					<span>In the sylvan dale,</span><br>
                    <span>Harmony sweet and fluted</span><br>
                    <span>- Like the nightingale?</span><br><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Rizal then notices the presence of sweet melodies in the “sylvan dale” or a wooded valley. He describes the harmony as being as sweet as the song of a nightingale, suggesting a joyful and peaceful atmosphere.

					<span>With the winds that pass?</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">

                    <span>While lullaby zephyrs sing</span><br>
                    <span>Like its crystal showers?</span><br><br>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    The poet reflects on the beauty of the crystal-clear spring flowing through the flowers. The “lullaby zephyrs” or gentle breezes sing softly, creating a soothing atmosphere.

					<span>In a carmine cloud?</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Here, Rizal continues the serene theme of the poem, personifying the dawn breaking in the East as a beautiful figure going to a feast adorned in a “carmine cloud”, which could represent the colors of the sunrise.

                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Here, it is revealed that the celebration he describes is in honor of his mother’s birthday.

                    <span>The murmurous spring this day</span><br>

					<span>To live in joy.</span><br><br>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Rizal speaks of a “murmurous spring” which could be a metaphor for a gentle flow of water. This spring seems to murmur a message to his mother, wishing her a life filled with joy.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="tooltip-custom right">
                <p class="underline highlight1">
                    <span>While the crystalline murmurs glisten,</span><br>
                    <span>Hear you the accents strong</span><br>
                    <span>Struck from my lyre, listen!</span><br>
                    <span>To my love's first song.</span>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    In the final stanza, Rizal urges his mother to listen to the murmurs of the spring, which symbolize his own wishes for his mother. He refers to his poem as “my love’s first song”, indicating that this poem is an expression of his love and admiration for his mother.
