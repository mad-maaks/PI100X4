            Piden que pulse la lira<br>
            Ha tiempo callada y rota:<br>
            Si ya no arranco una nota<br>
            Ni mi musa ya me inspira!<br>
            Balbuce fría y delira<br>
            Si la tortura mi mente;<br>
            Cuando ríe solo miente;<br>
            Como miente su lamento:<br>
            Y es que en mi triste aislamiento<br>
            Mi alma ni goza ni siente.                    
		</p>
        <p>
            Hubo un tiempo ... y es verdad!<br>
            Pero ya aquel tiempo huyó,<br>
            En que vate me llamo<br>
            La indulgencia a la amistad.<br>
            Ahora de aquella edad<br>
            El recuerdo apenas resta<br>
            Como quedan de una fiesta<br>
            Los misteriosos sonidos<br>
            Que retienen los oídos<br>
            Del bullicio de la orquesta.
        </p>
        <p>
            Soy planta apenas crecida<br>
            Arrancada del Oriente,<br>
            Donde es perfume el ambiente,<br>
            Donde es un sueño la vida:<br>
            Patria que jamás se olvida!<br>
            Enseñáronme a cantar<br>
            Las aves, con su trinar;<br>
            Con su rumor, las cascadas;<br>
            Y en sus playas dilatadas,<br>
            Los murmullos de la mar.

		<div class="center" id="grid">	
			<div class="tooltip-wrapper">
				<div class="tooltip-custom right">
				  <p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>They ask me to play on a lyre</span><br>
                    <span>That long has been still and decayed,</span><br>
                    <span>But never a note have I played,</span><br>
                    <span>Nor can I the Muse re-inspire.</span><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					The poem starts with the speaker being asked to write poetry. The “lyre” here is often a symbol of poetry and music, representing Rizal’s past creative expression. The fact that it is “still and decayed” suggests that Rizal hasn’t written poetry in a while. He expresses his struggles in writing, and how he can’t get his inspiration and motivation to write back.
				  </span>
				</div>
				<div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>She chats without reason or fire</span><br>
					<span>Until she has tortured my brain.</span><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					These lines suggest that Rizal’s poetry lacks the “reason or fire” needed for good poetry. This lack of inspiration becomes a torment for Rizal, his muse, instead of helping, “tortures” him with the struggle to create.
				  </span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>She chuckles to jeer at my pain;</span><br>
					<span>She has mocked me the while I lamented.</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Rizal then personifies the muse as mocking, she doesn’t seem to care about Rizal’s suffering and even laughs at it. The muse offers no comfort to him, only mockery.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom left">
                <p class="underline highlight2">
                    <span>In my soul, lonely, sad, and tormented,</span><br>
                    <span>Neither pleasure nor sorrow remain.</span><br><br>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Here, we can see how the effect of the lack of inspiration for Rizal takes its toll on him. He expresses that his soul feels “lonely, sad, and tormented”. The struggle to create has drained him so much, that he feels devoid of joy or pain.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>There once was a time, it is true--</span><br>
					<span>A time that, alas, has departed.</span><br>
                    <span>When friends who were generous-hearted,</span><br>
                    <span>Applauded the verse I could do.</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					The poem then shifts to a reminiscing tone, he describes the time when his works were appreciated by his friends, how he was admired for his poetry. He describes this in a very melancholic way, stating that this memory has long since departed.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom left">
                <p class="underline highlight2">
                    <span>Of those happy days but a few</span><br>
                    <span>Obscured recollections yet stay,</span><br>
                    <span>As after some high holiday,</span><br>
                    <span>Still linger mysterious sounds;</span><br>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Rizal then says how those good times are fading to him, that only a few remain. Despite this, those memories still linger to him like faint sounds after a celebration, although unclear.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>Or, after the concert resounds,</span><br>
					<span>The after tones whisper away.</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					He further emphasizes the fading nature of his past, here. He describes this with the “concert resounds”, how the “after tones” will gradually fade away.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom left">
                <p class="underline highlight1">
                    <span>For I am a plant immature,</span><br>
                    <span>Torn out of the Orient where</span><br>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Rizal then compares himself to a young plant, uprooted from its natural environment. This represents how he must have felt during the time he was writing this, when he was away from the Philippines.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>The perfumes sleep on the air</span><br>
					<span>And life is a dream to allure.</span><br>
                    <span>Ah, memories ever endure,</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					These lines evoke a sense of peace and beauty in his homeland; this is symbolized by the “perfumes” sleeping in the air. He further describes the Philippines as if it was a dream, suggesting how he misses his homeland and how it is his source of inspiration.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom left">
                <p class="underline highlight1">
                    <span>My Country, of songs taught to me</span><br>
                    <span>By warbling birds from the tree,</span><br>
                    <span>The waterfall's silvery roar,</span><br>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Here, Rizal directly speaks about his homeland, the Philippines, how he cherishes his memories of his time there, and how this is what fuels his creative spirit.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="tooltip-custom right">
                <p class="underline highlight2">
                    <span>And out on the far-reaching shore,</span><br>
                    <span>The moan of the sounding sea.</span>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    The poem ends with the image of the ocean’s sound, another reminder of his homeland. In this poem, he explores his struggle with writer’s block, and the power of memory and his homeland in fueling his creative passion.</span>
