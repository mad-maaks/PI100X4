            ¡Id á mi Patria, id extranjeras flores<br>
            sembradas del viajero en el camino,<br>
            y bajo su azul cielo,<br>
            que guarda mis amores,<br>
            contad del peregrino<br>
            la fe que alienta por su patrio suelo!            
		</p>
		<p>
            Id y decíd: decíd que cuando el alba<br>
            vuestro cáliz abrió por vez primera,<br>
            cabe el Neckar helado,<br>
            le vísteis silencioso á vuestro lado<br>
            pensando en su constante primavera.            
		</p>
		<p>
            Decíd que cuando el alba,<br>
            que roba vuestro aroma,<br>
            cantos de amor jugando os susurraba,<br>
            él también murmuraba            
		</p>
        <p>
            cantos de amor en su natal idioma...<br>
        </p>
		<p>
            Que cuando el sol la cumbre<br>
            del Koënigsthul en la mañana dora,<br>
            y con su tibia lumbre<br>
            anima el valle, el bosque y la espesura,<br>
            el Saluda ese sol, aún en su aurora,<br>
            al que en su patria en el zenith fulgura.
		</p>
		<p>
            Y contad aquel dia<br>
            cuando os cogía al borde del sendero,<br>
            entre las ruinas del feudal Castillo<br>
            orilla al Neckar ó en la selva umbría...            
		</p>
		<p>
            Llevad, llevad, ¡oh flores!<br>
            amor á mis amores<br>
            paz á mi pais y á su fecunda tierra,<br>
            salud á dulces seres<br>
            fé á sus hombres; virtud á sus mujeres,<br>
            que el paternal, sagrado hogar encierra...

				  <p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>Go to my native land, go, foreign flowers,</span><br>
					<span>Sown by the traveler on his way,</span><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Here, Rizal being the traveler, has sown flowers from the foreign country he is in. Rizal directly addresses these flowers, asking them to go to his homeland, the Philippines. We can also view these flowers as the knowledge and experiences Rizal gained while he was staying in Germany.
				  </span>
				</div>
				<div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>And there, beneath its azure sky,</span><br>
					<span>Where all my afflictions lie;</span><br>
				  </p>
				  <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					These lines capture Rizal’s deep love for the Philippines while also struggling with the problems and abuses the nation was facing during that time. It showcases the love and pain that Rizal felt for his homeland.
				  </span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>There from the weary pilgrim say</span><br>
					<span>What faith is his in that land of ours!</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Rizal sees himself here as a “pilgrim” or a wanderer, yearning for his home. He asks the flowers to convey his “faith”, and declares his unwavering belief and trust in his homeland.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom left">
                <p class="underline highlight1">
                    <span>Go there and tell how when the dawn,</span><br>
                    <span>Her early light diffusing,</span><br>
                    <span>Your petals first flung open wide;</span><br>
                </p>
                <span class="tooltiptext-custom">
                    Essentially, Rizal wants his countrymen to know the peaceful and hopeful moments he experiences. This is seen with the personification of the dawn as a female figure, describing the gradual spread of her light, as well as the imagery of flowers blooming at dawn, which could symbolize new beginnings, hope, and joy.
                </span>
                </div>
                <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>His steps beside chill Neckar drawn,</span><br>
					<span>You see him silent by your side</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					These lines create an image of a figure in solitude, standing by the Neckar river while lost in his thoughts. The river itself often has a symbolic meaning in literature, representing the flow of life. In this context, the figure standing by the river might signify a moment of pause for contemplation amidst everything going on.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>Upon its Spring perennial musing,</span><br>
					<span>Say how when morning's light,</span><br>
                    <span>All your fragrance stealing,</span><br>
                    <span>Whispers to you as in mirth,</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Here, the lines paint a picture of the poet being lost in his thoughts in a “perennial” way, suggesting a state of constant contemplation, while also creating a vivid image of a peaceful spring morning. The springtime setting can be a symbol of hope and renewal, so, amidst this contemplation, there is also appreciation of the new day as it unfolds.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight2">
					<span>Playful songs of Love's delight,</span><br>
					<span>He, too, murmurs his love's feeling</span><br>
					<span>In the tongue he learned at birth.</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					This suggests that the morning atmosphere is filled with the spirit of love and happiness, as the poet expresses his own in “the tongue he learned at birth”, or his native language, Tagalog, highlighting his deep-rooted sense of identity and love for the Philippines. This further emphasizes his deep longing for his homeland.

				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>That when the sun of Koenigsthul's height</span><br>
					<span>Pours out its golden flood,</span><br>
					<span>And with its slowly warming light</span><br>	
                    <span>Gives life to vale and grove and wood,</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					These lines depict a scene at midday this time, bathed in warm sunlight. It highlights how the sun brings life to the valleys, groves, and trees, and creates a vivid image of a landscape revitalized by the sun.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight2">			
					<span>He greets that sun, here only apraising,</span><br>
					<span>Which in his native land is at its zenith blazing.</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Here, Rizal establishes the difference between the sun he sees in Heidelberg and the sun in the Philippines. While he appreciates the sun in Heidelberg, he sees it as comparatively less intense and less blazing than the sun in his homeland. The sun here can be a symbol of life, where he sees the Philippines as a place where life feels fuller and more vibrant, than that of Heidelberg.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>And tell there of that day he stood,</span><br>
					<span>Near to a ruin'd castle gray,</span><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Now, Rizal is trying to relay a specific memory to his homeland, with imagery showing a sense of melancholy and contemplation. The ruined castle here could be a symbol of the passage of time and the eventual decay of things.
				</span>
			  </div>
			  <div class="tooltip-custom right">
				<p class="underline highlight2"> 				
					<span>By Neckar's banks, or shady wood,</span><br>
					<span>And pluck'd you beside the way</span><br><br>			
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Here, it seems that while being surrounded by nature, he is also forming a personal attachment to them. The act of picking the flowers he encountered could symbolize the desire to hold onto his experiences in Heidelberg, with the “flower” becoming sort of a memento of his time abroad.
				</span>
			</div>
			<div class="tooltip-custom left">
				<p class="underline highlight1">
					<span>Tell, too, the tale to you addressed,</span><br>
					<span>And how with tender care,</span><br>
                    <span>Your bending leaves he press'd</span><br>
                    <span>Twist pages of some volume rare.</span><br><br>
				</p>
				<span class="tooltiptext-custom">
					Here, the lines show the deep connection between the speaker and the flowers. The flowers become symbols of his experiences and learnings, which he seeks to preserve. It mentions the act of pressing flowers in a book, which shows how the speaker is essentially trying to keep that moment in time, while also linking these experiences with his own personal history.
